        <move name="Act Under Pressure">
            When you race against the clock, act while in danger, or act to avoid danger, roll Cool.
                10+: you do it, no problem
                7-9: you stumble, hesitate, or flinch: the MC will offer you a worse outcome, hard bargain, or ugly choice
